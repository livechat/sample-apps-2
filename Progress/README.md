#  Progress

Simple application that shows how to create Agent App Extension with use of LiveChat Rest Api.

Progress is a sample app that creates reports based on data from chats.

In widget you can find statistics about:

- **Ratings** ( per day, week, month, year)
- **Chatting times**  ( per day, week, month, year)
- [Response Time](https://docs.livechatinc.com/rest-api/#chats-first-response-time)  ( per day, week, month, year)

## How to start?

In order to use this application in your LiveChat dashboard,

first of all you have to create your own app in [Developers Console](https://developers.livechatinc.com/console)
and get **Client Id**.

To do so:
1. Go to [apps](https://developers.livechatinc.com/console/apps)
2. Click **New App** and give it a name.
3. Go to **Develop** -> **Building Blocks**
4. Add **Authorizaton** and mark it as **Web App**
5. Your **Client Id** will be displayed there.
6. Go to `src/utils/config.js` in your project and replace **client_id** with your own **client id**
7. That's all. Don't forget to add your app url to **Redirect URI whitelist**

##  How it works?

[Agent App Widgets](https://docs.livechatinc.com/agent-app-widgets/) are web applications loaded inside the LiveChat Agent App. All agents can interact with the widget during chats with customers. The widget itself is displayed in the Agentâ€™s App sidebar as you can see on pictures above.

To get information like tags and canned responses we need to use [LiveChat Rest Api](https://docs.livechatinc.com/rest-api/).

Rest Api requires you to include **access_token** in all requests in order to get information from our server. You can get it using [LiveChat Boilerplate](https://docs.livechatinc.com/boilerplate/) and [JavaScript Widget API](https://docs.livechatinc.com/agent-app-widgets/#javascript-api).


You should also get familiar with [Authorization](https://docs.livechatinc.com/authorization/).

If you found any bugs, please create issue in this repo and I will try to fix is ASAP ;)


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
