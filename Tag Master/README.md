# Tag Master

<!--It's a simple application that shows how to create an Agent App extension with the use of the **LiveChat Rest API**.-->

**Tag Master** allows you to create, view, and delete [tags](https://www.livechatinc.com/kb/tagging-chats-and-tickets/) and [canned responses](https://www.livechatinc.com/kb/canned-responses/) in an easy and predictable way.

# App setup

## Before you start

To use this application in your LiveChat dashboard, you'll need to create your own app in [Developers Console](https://developers.livechatinc.com/console) and get the **Client Id**.

## Getting started

1. Go to [Apps](https://developers.livechatinc.com/console/apps) in [Developers Console](https://developers.livechatinc.com/console).
2. Click **New App** and give it an **App Name**.
3. Select *Agent App Widget* as the **App Template**.
4. Go to **Develop -> Building Blocks**.
5. Add **App Authorization** and mark it as *JavaScript App*. Your **Client Id** will be displayed there.
6. Fetch the **Tag Master** app repository.
7. In the app directory, do the following steps :

    * Install dependencies (`npm install`).
    * In your project, go to `src/utils/congif.js` and replace `client_id` with your own **Client Id** (the one from **Step 5**).
    * Run your app (`npm start`).
8. Add your app url (for example: `https://localhost:3000`) in these two locations:

    * **Redirect URI whitelist**
    * **Agent App Widgets**
9. In **Private installation**, click **Install app**. 

You should now be able to use **Tag Master** with LiveChat.



# How it works

[Agent App Widgets](https://docs.livechatinc.com/agent-app-widgets/) are web applications loaded inside the LiveChat Agent App. All agents can interact with the widget during chats with customers. The widget itself is displayed in the Agentâ€™s App right sidebar.

To get information such as tags and canned responses, you need to use [LiveChat Rest API](https://docs.livechatinc.com/rest-api/).

In order to pull data from our server, Rest API requires you to include an **access_token** in all the requests. You can get it using [LiveChat Boilerplate](https://docs.livechatinc.com/boilerplate/) and [JavaScript Widget API](https://docs.livechatinc.com/agent-app-widgets/#javascript-api).

You should also get familiar with [Authorization](https://docs.livechatinc.com/authorization/).
